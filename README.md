# Polygon
Polygon language source code

# About
Over a year ago Polygon was created to send, retrieve and read data from certain areas of the internet for cyber security. This here is some of the source code.
Polygon was abandoned over 8 months ago now and has not been brought back since, due to it being rewritten in a much easier language and method. 
I have permission to release some of my code from the language. I mainly focused on Python with ASM and some web stuff. I have permission to release this code. 

Also ASM is a total bitch

# Usage
It's heavily stripped down. From 760,000+ lines to about 400. If you can find a usage here do what you like with it.
